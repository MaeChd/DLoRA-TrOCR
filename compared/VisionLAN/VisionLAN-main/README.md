# From Two to One: A New Scene Text Recognizer with Visual Language Modeling Network

The official code of [VisionLAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09661) (ICCV2021). VisionLAN successfully achieves the transformation from two-step to one-step
recognition (from Two to One), which adaptively considers both visual and linguistic information in a unified structure without the need of extra language model.

## Data preparing
### Training sets 
[SynthText](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/scenetext/) We use the [tool](https://github.com/FangShancheng/ABINet/tree/main/tools) to crop images from original SynthText dataset, and convert images into LMDB dataset.

[MJSynth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/) We use [tool](https://github.com/FangShancheng/ABINet/blob/main/tools/create_lmdb_dataset.py) to convert images into LMDB dataset. (We only use training set in this implementation)

We have upload these LMDB datasets in [RuiKe](https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/2fad9400-28b3-11ec-8047-c76e50c198dd) (password:x6si) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_2dqqxW1vDL9t3B-jlAYRw)(password:z0r5)

### Visualize character-wise mask map
Examples of the visualization of mask_c:
![image](https://github.com/wangyuxin87/VisionLAN/blob/main/examples/mask_c.png)
```bash 
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python visualize.py
```
You can modify the 'mask_id' in cfgs/cfgs_visualize to change the P for visualization.

### Results on OST datasets 
Occlusion Scene Text (OST) dataset is proposed to reflect the ability for recognizing cases with missing visual cues. This dataset is collected from 6
benchmarks (IC13, IC15, IIIT5K, SVT, SVTP and CT) containing 4832 images. Images in this dataset are manually occluded in weak or heavy degree. Weak
and heavy degrees mean that we occlude the character using one or two lines. For each image, we randomly choose one degree to only cover one character.

Examples of images in OST dataset:

The LMDB dataset is available in [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1YOIQ0z7j2Qp4Z5JbVon6CQ) (password:yrrj) or [RuiKe](https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/2e9d6ec0-28c4-11ec-8102-9b471bd02592) (password: vmzr)

## Training
4 2080Ti GPUs are used in this implementation. 

### Language-free (LF) process
You can follow this implementation to train your own vision model.

Step 1 (LF_1): We first train the vision model without MLM.

```bash 
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_LF_1.py
```
 We provide our trained LF_1 model in [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QNMSXFB2MFLIaCP0_0Va7Q) (password:avs5) and [RuiKe](https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/42167c40-28c5-11ec-86bc-1be5441a39ac) (password:qwzn))

Step 2 (LF_2): We finetune the MLM with vision model.

```bash 
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_LF_2.py
```

### Language-aware (LA) process

Download our trained LF_2 model [(BaiduYun)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zv-kKZGREjScW6p2dSwcXw) (password:04jg) or [RuiKe](https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/84a19b50-28c5-11ec-87c6-35ad826f4060) (password:v67q), and put it in /output/LF_2/LF_2.pth.

Then
```bash 
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train_LA.py
```

Tips: In LA process, model with loss (Loss VisionLAN) higher than 0.3 and the training accuracy (Accuracy) lower than 91.0 after the first 200 training iters obains better performance. 

# Improvement
1. Mask id randomly generated according to the max length can not well adapt to the occlusion of long text. Thus, evenly sampled mask id can further improve the performance of MLM. 
2. Heavier vision model is able to capture more robust linguistic information in our later experiments.
